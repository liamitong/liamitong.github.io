            <h2>Artwork</h2>
            <p>Here you will find a selection of various artwork that I think is pretty cool. I've worked with a lot of programs and mediums in my program so far, so I think its pretty neat to have a lot of different types of artwork to look at. </p>

            <h2>Cotton Candy</h2>
            <a href="images/cottoncandy.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="thumb/cottoncandy-min.jpg" alt="Digital painting named Cotton Candy" class="horizontal"></a>
            <p>This was my first real crack at a proper digital painting using photoshop. It was of fun playing with the different brushes and colors to get something that looked slightly coherent. I got some fun abstract structures and even some little silly guys hiding the clouds.</p>

            <h2>That Boiled Egg Feeling</h2>
            <a href="images/facething.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="thumb/facething-min.jpg" alt="Digital composite named That Boiled Egg Feeling"></a>
            <p>This was a composite made from a variety of different stock images I found on the internet. I think it looks pretty sick. Not entirely sure about the exact message being conveyed here, but being in her situation looks like it would probably hurt my face. Might just be my favorite of the bunch, I may put together more composites in my spare time if I'm feeling up to it.</p>

            <h2>Boom</h2>
            <a href="images/boom.png" target="_blank"><img src="thumb/boom-min.png" alt="Traditional drawing named Boom" class="horizontal"></a>
            <p>This piece here is a good showcase of the little abstract doodles I like to mess with. This one is a full piece built up entirely of those doodles. In this one I tried to incorpate some perspective in it as well, which I think turned out pretty cool.</p>

            <h2>Candle Man</h2>
            <a href="images/huug.png" target="_blank"><img src="thumb/huug-min.png" alt="Digital Drawing named Candle Man" class="horizontal"></a>
            <p>This is a bit of an older digtal drawing I did. I decided to showcase it because I thought it was a good represetnation of the little dudes that I enjoy drawing. I always enjoy experiementing with different variations of these creatures which can be adapted to suite just about any need!</p>

            <h2>Moodboard</h2>
            <a href="images/moodboard.png" target="_blank"><img src="thumb/moodboard-min.png" alt="Moodboard" class="horizontal"></a>
            <p>Finally, my overall moodboard. It's a mixture of art, doodles, music, people, and things that inspire me. It was orginally suppose to be a lot more structured, but due to an error when exporting the file it came out much more chaotic looking. I decided to roll with it because I felt it express my mood a lot better than what I had previously had.   </p>
