            <h2>Videos</h2>
            <p>In this place you'll find a small colleciton of some of the videos I've worked on. I've always had a love for making and editing little videos so this is probably my favorite spot here. I've worked with a variety of programs from the simple iMovie all the way to Premiere Pro. I've always had fun experimenting with editing styles and I think this group of videos showcases that. I think. Maybe. I just think they're funny.</p>

            <p>This is a simple day-in-the-life sort of video that shows off what I get up to during the day. Fairly mundane, but showcases the kind of person I am and the sorts of things I find joy in my day-to-day life.</p>

            <p>For this we were asked in class to make a commerical for anything. I've got a lot weird junk I picked up from gas stations, so I decided to use a holographic picture of a pig as my subject for the ad.</p>

            <p>These are some of my favorite TikToks I've made. The platform is pretty much a black box when it comes to what blows up, so I just try to post what I like rather than chasing trends. This selection consits of random jokes, gameplay videos, my dog, and random clips of nature I got on my various wanderings in the forest.</p>
