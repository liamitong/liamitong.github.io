            <h2>Photography</h2>
            <p>Here is where all of my favorite recent photo work is here for you to take a look at. I've enjoyed photography for a while now, but I've recently got access to a much higher-quality camera and have been having fun learning about the fundementals of photography. </p>

            <h2>Splatter</h2>
            <a href="images/Tree.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="thumb/Tree-min.jpg" alt="Photo of a Tree"></a>
            <p>This was an photo I took that I felt showed off a great use of contrast. I love taking pictures of nature and finding ways to abstract it fun ways, and I felt this was the best representation of that. To me, this looks like some kind of abstract painting with splatters of block flowing upward. I also just think its neat.</p>

            <h2>Power Plant</h2>
            <a href="images/Pole.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="thumb/Pole-min.jpg" alt="Photo of an Electric Pole"></a>
            <p>I really enjoyed the compostion of this photo. The symmetry of elements I feel really make for a fun dynamic of the natural trees to the manufactured powerline. I also like the little leading lines from the powerline. They are cool.</p>

            <h2>Calm in the Storm</h2>
            <a href="images/Moon.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="thumb/Moon-min.jpg" alt="Photo of the moon surrounded by tree branches" class="horizontal"></a>
            <p>I took this photo on a bike ride out in the woods. This was really a in the moment sort of shot, it was just about to be too dark out but I managed to get this cool framing shot.</p>

            <h2>Criss Cross</h2>
            <a href="images/bridge.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="thumb/bridge-min.jpg" alt="Photo of a Bridge" class="horizontal"></a>
            <p>This one's pretty neat. This is a picture of a bridge at a bit of a strange angle with a longer lens. This gave it a really nice flattening effect to the image while keeping the lines interesting.</p>

            <h2>Good Fellow</h2>
            <a href="images/dog.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="thumb/dog-min.jpg" alt="Photo of my dog"></a>
            <p>This one is a just a picture of my dog. He loves to run around like a maniac so getting picture of him was a difficult task. I really liked that I was able to get it framed up just right and was able to get the background blurred. If my dog ever had a LinkedIn, this would probably be his picure.</p>
